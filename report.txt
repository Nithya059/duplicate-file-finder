Duplicate File Finder – Technical Report

This project solves the problem of duplicate files by hashing file contents.

1. File Traversal
os.walk() is used to recursively scan the folder.

2. Hashing
Each file is read in chunks and hashed using SHA-256.
Identical files produce identical hashes.

3. Data Structure
A dictionary maps hash → list of file paths.

4. Detection
Hashes with more than one path are duplicates.

5. Deletion Logic
--delete flag activates delete mode.
User confirmation prevents accidental loss.

Why hashing?
Filename comparison is unreliable.
Hashing guarantees content equality.

This design is efficient, safe, and scalable.
